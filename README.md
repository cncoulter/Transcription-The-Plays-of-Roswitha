# *The Plays of Roswitha* translated by Christopher St. John

## Description

Roswitha, also known as Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, was a tenth century German canoness, dramatist, and poet. Inspired by the Roman playwright Terence, but also upset by his immoral subject matter, Roswitha sought to "Christianize" his work through six plays of her own.
